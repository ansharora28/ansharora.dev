        Hi! I'm Ansh, a 20 year old hobbyist developer based out of India, currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        I'm a full stack developer but particularly enjoy working with various front end web technologies. I'm also a community first person, who spends a lot of time building and managing developer communities. 
        Currently, I'm working as an intern at FOSS United, a non profit aimed at promoting the creation and usage of Free and Open Source Software.<br><br>
        I like to say that I'm a evangelist by day and developer by night :D
