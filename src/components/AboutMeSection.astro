          Hi! I'm Ansh, a 20-year-old Computer Science student based out of India.
          <br><br>
          I'm a front end developer in love with everything Javascript. I'm also a community-first person, who spends a lot of time building and managing developer communities. 
          <br><br>Currently, I'm working as a Program and Partnerships Manager at <a href="https://fossunited.org/" style="color: blue;">FOSS United</a>, a Non Profit Organisation aimed at promoting the creation and usage of Free and Open Source Software in India. I have also worked as a Community Evangelist at OpenWeaver, and as an SDE Intern at Essentia Softserve.<br><br>
          I spend my time reading, watching movies and saving the city outside working hours.
